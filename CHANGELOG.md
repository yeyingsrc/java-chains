  See https://github.com/4ra1n/mysql-fake-server.
- [Feature] The Generate module now offers a URL Encoding option.
- [Feature] Added the `preTags` field in gadget annotations, which can be used to specify preceding chains.
- [Feature] Synchronously updated [Class-Obf](https://github.com/jar-analyzer/class-obf) to version v1.4.0.
- [Improvement] JNDI, JRMP, etc. modules will now provide a warning if the port is not open.
- [Improvement] Improved frontend icon display.
- [Improvement] Refactored backend code.
- [Bugfix] Fixed the Groovy Jar generation issue. Fastjson Groovy Jars can now be generated through OtherPayload ->
  GroovyJarConvert.

## 1.2.4

- [Feature] Synchronized update to Class-Obf v1.3.1 (https://github.com/jar-analyzer/class-obf) @4ra1n

- [Bugfix] Fixed front-end expansion issue by @Ar3h

## 1.2.2

What's new:

- [Feature] Support internationalization, the page supports English switching, and the language can be switched in the
